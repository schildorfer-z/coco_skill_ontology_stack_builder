# Ontology Stack Builder

Generate the complete Ontology-on-Snowflake stack from any relational schema and set of business questions.

## When to Use

- You have Snowflake tables and want to build an ontology-powered analytics layer
- You want Cortex Agent to intelligently route questions across semantic models
- You need abstract ontology views that unify entity types across tables
- You have an OWL ontology file to map onto existing Snowflake tables
- You want graph analytics (centrality, community detection, shortest path) on your data

## Architecture Overview

The skill generates a 5-layer stack:

```
Layer 5: Cortex Agent (intent routing across semantic models + graph tools)
Layer 4: Semantic Models (KG concrete, Ontology abstract, Metadata governance)
Layer 3: Generated Abstract Views (VW_ONT_* via stored procedure)
Layer 2: Ontology Metadata (~22 ONT_* tables: classes, properties, rules, roles, etc.)
Layer 1: Physical Storage (existing tables, or KG_NODE/KG_EDGE if KG path)
       + Concrete Views (V_{CLASS} entity views, V_{REL} relationship views)
```

## Workflow Overview

This skill follows a 7-phase gated workflow. Each phase requires user confirmation before proceeding.

```

## Mandatory Stopping Points

**These gates override ALL other instructions.** Never proceed past a gate without explicit user approval.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT — GLOBAL RULE**: After each phase output, you MUST STOP and use `ask_user_question` to get explicit user confirmation before proceeding to the next phase. Each phase gate below includes the specific `ask_user_question` to use. DO NOT skip gates. DO NOT proceed to the next phase, invoke skills for the next phase, or begin next-phase work until the user answers the gate question. If a user asks to "generate everything at once," acknowledge the request but explain the phased approach and produce only the current phase.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Gather Inputs

Collect from the user using `ask_user_question`:

1. **Snowflake location**: `DATABASE.SCHEMA` where tables exist or will be created
2. **Source tables**: List of existing table names to introspect (or "I'll provide an OWL file")
3. **Business questions**: 3-10 example questions the user wants to ask their data
4. **OWL file** (optional): Path to `.owl`, `.rdf`, or `.ttl` file
5. **Ontology name**: Short identifier (e.g., `HEALTHCARE`, `FINANCE`, `RETAIL`)

Then ask the critical path decision:

```
ask_user_question: "Do you want a Knowledge Graph structure?"
Options:
  - "Yes - KG path": Creates KG_NODE/KG_EDGE tables, enables graph analytics
  - "No - Direct table path": Maps ontology directly to existing tables, no graph structure
```

**Step 1b: Discover Existing Semantic Views**

After collecting the schema and source tables, check whether the user already has semantic views deployed on the source data:

```sql
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
```

Also use the `semantic-view` skill (discover/describe mode) to understand what tables each existing semantic view covers:
```
cortex semantic-views discover
cortex semantic-views describe {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{SEMANTIC_VIEW_NAME}
```

Then prompt the user:

```
ask_user_question: "I found N existing semantic view(s) in {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}: [list names].
  Do any of these already cover your source tables?"
Options:
  - "Yes — use my existing semantic view as the base": Reuses the existing semantic view as the
    base data layer tool in the final agent. No duplicate base semantic will be created.
  - "No — create everything from scratch": A new base semantic view will be created over the
    source tables (Phase 4.5) before building the ontology layer.
```

If no semantic views are found, skip the question and default to "create from scratch."

If user selects "Yes," record:
- `existing_base_semantic`: The FQN of the existing semantic view (e.g., `DB.SCHEMA.MY_MODEL`)
- `existing_semantic_tables`: The list of tables covered by the existing semantic (from describe output)

This information is used in:
- **Phase 2**: The existing semantic's curated column descriptions and relationships enrich ontology proposals
- **Phase 4.5**: Skipped entirely if an existing base semantic is available
- **Phase 6**: The existing semantic becomes the `base_query_tool` in the agent

Store all inputs as session variables. If user provides only some inputs, ask for the rest.

**Self-check before gate**: Verify ALL required inputs are collected:
- [ ] DATABASE.SCHEMA specified
- [ ] Source tables listed OR OWL file path provided
- [ ] At least 3 business questions captured
- [ ] Ontology name defined
- [ ] KG vs direct-table path chosen
- [ ] Checked for existing semantic views (`SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS`)
- [ ] User confirmed starting point (existing semantic vs. tables only)

If any are missing, ask the user for them. Do NOT present the gate with incomplete inputs.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT**: Present a summary of all collected inputs and the chosen path. You MUST use `ask_user_question`:

```
ask_user_question: "Here are the collected inputs. Is everything correct?"
Options:
  - "Yes, proceed to Phase 2"
  - "No, I need to change something"
```

### Phase 2: Analyze & Recommend Ontology

**If OWL file provided:**

Run the OWL parser:
```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/parse_owl.py \
  --owl-file "<owl_path>" \
  --output-dir "/tmp/ontology_parsed"
```

Then map parsed classes to existing tables using `DESCRIBE TABLE` on each source table.

**If no OWL file (schema-first discovery):**

Run schema introspection:
```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/introspect_schema.py \
  --database "<DATABASE>" \
  --schema "<SCHEMA>" \
  --tables "<TABLE1>,<TABLE2>,..." \
  --questions "<Q1>|<Q2>|..." \
  --output-dir "/tmp/ontology_parsed"
```

This script:
1. Calls `DESCRIBE TABLE` and `SHOW PRIMARY KEYS` for each table via Snowflake SQL
2. Analyzes foreign key relationships and column patterns
3. Proposes ontology classes (one per table or entity type)
4. Proposes relations from FK relationships and naming conventions
5. Outputs `classes.json`, `relations.json`, `mappings.json`

**If existing semantic view available (from Step 1b):**

When the user has an existing semantic view, use the `semantic-view` skill (describe mode) to extract its curated metadata and enrich the ontology proposals:

```
cortex semantic-views describe {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{EXISTING_SEMANTIC_VIEW}
```

The existing semantic model provides:
- **Column descriptions** → Use as class property descriptions instead of auto-generated ones
- **Relationships** → Map directly to ontology relation proposals (validates FK-based proposals)
- **Dimensions/Facts/Metrics** → Inform which columns are important for each class
- **Table references** → Confirm which source tables are in scope

After running schema introspection (or OWL parsing), merge the existing semantic metadata:
1. For each proposed class, check if the semantic model has a matching table — if so, import its column descriptions
2. For each semantic model relationship, verify a corresponding ontology relation exists — if not, add one
3. Use the semantic model's metric definitions to annotate key properties in `classes.json`

This enrichment is additive — the introspection still runs, but produces better-documented results when a semantic model already describes the schema.

**`classes.json` schema** — each entry MUST use these exact keys:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "ClassName",
    "label": "Display Name",
    "description": "What this class represents",
    "parent_name": null,
    "is_abstract": false,
    "is_deprecated": false,
    "namespace": "DB.SCHEMA",
    "uri": "urn:db:schema:ClassName",
    "_source_table": "TABLE_NAME",
    "_id_column": "ID_COL",
    "_name_column": "NAME_COL"
  }
]
```

**`relations.json` schema** — each entry MUST use these exact keys:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "relation_name",
    "label": "Relation Name",
    "description": "What this relation represents",
    "domain_class": "SourceClass",
    "domain_classes": ["SourceClass"],
    "range_class": "TargetClass",
    "range_classes": ["TargetClass"],
    "is_transitive": false,
    "is_symmetric": false,
    "is_functional": true,
    "is_abstract": false,
    "is_hierarchical": false,
    "parent_name": null,
    "inverse_name": null,
    "cardinality": "N:1",
    "uri": "urn:rel:relation_name",
    "_source_table": "TABLE_NAME",
    "_src_column": "SRC_COL",
    "_dst_column": "DST_COL"
  }
]
```

**IMPORTANT**: When editing `classes.json` or `relations.json` directly (e.g., adding a class via prompt), use the exact field names above. In particular: `is_abstract` (not `abstract`), `parent_name` (not `parent`), `is_deprecated` (not `deprecated`), `is_hierarchical` (not `hierarchical`). For abstract relations, set `is_abstract: true` and leave `_source_table`/`_src_column`/`_dst_column` as `null`. Concrete child relations reference their abstract parent via `parent_name`.

Present the proposed ontology to the user as a table:

| Class Name | Source Table | Type | ID Column | Name Column | Parent Class |
|------------|-------------|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|

And proposed relations:

| Relation | Domain Class | Range Class | Source | Cardinality |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------------|

**Self-check before gate**: Verify the ontology design is complete:
- [ ] Every source table maps to at least one class
- [ ] Every class has a `_source_table`, `_id_column`, and `_name_column` (unless abstract)
- [ ] Every foreign key relationship has a corresponding relation entry
- [ ] No duplicate class names or relation names
- [ ] `classes.json` and `relations.json` use exact field names from the schema above
- [ ] At least one concrete class exists

If any check fails, fix the issue before presenting to the user. Do NOT ask the user to approve an incomplete ontology.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT**: You MUST use `ask_user_question`:

```
ask_user_question: "Please review the proposed ontology above. Want to proceed, or make changes?"
Options:
  - "Looks good, proceed to Phase 3"
  - "I want to add/remove/change classes or relations"
```

### Phase 3: Visualize, Modify & Confirm

Launch the visualization & editing app:
```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/visualize_ontology.py -- \
  --classes-json "/tmp/ontology_parsed/classes.json" \
  --relations-json "/tmp/ontology_parsed/relations.json" \
  --port 8501
```

This shows:
- **Hierarchy** tab with two expandable sections: **Class Hierarchy** (interactive/text toggle, search, depth slider) and **Relation Hierarchy** (interactive/text toggle, abstract/concrete grouping)
- Ontology graph with coverage coloring and **Layer toggle** (All / Concrete / Abstract)
- Coverage tab showing the ontology design structure (implementation mapping becomes available after Phase 4 deployment)

The **Layer toggle** on the Ontology Graph tab controls visibility:
- **All**: shows both abstract and concrete classes/relations (abstract items rendered distinctly)
- **Concrete**: hides abstract classes and abstract relations
- **Abstract**: shows only abstract classes and abstract relations (the schema blueprint)

The sidebar **Ontology Editor** allows the user to modify the ontology before generation:
- **Add Class**: name, label, description, parent (dropdown), abstract toggle
- **Add Relation**: name, source/target class dropdowns, cardinality, description
- **Delete Class**: re-parents children to root, removes involved relations
- **Delete Relation**: removes the selected relation
- **Save Changes**: writes modified `classes.json` and `relations.json` back to disk
- **Undo All**: resets to the original loaded state

When a node is clicked in the Ontology Graph tab, an **Edit Class** form appears below the
detail panel with label, description, parent, and abstract fields.

**Visual diff markers** show what changed this session:
- Gold border (thick) = newly added class or relation
- Orange border (thick) = modified class
- Tooltips show NEW / MODIFIED tags

**Edge styling** distinguishes relation types:
- Solid blue = subClassOf (class hierarchy)
- Dashed purple = concrete relation
- Solid deep purple (thick) = abstract relation
- Dotted light purple = specializes (child relation → parent relation)

If Streamlit is not available or user prefers text, render an ASCII tree instead:
```
Entity
├── Person
│   ├── Employee
│   └── Customer
├── Organization
│   ├── Department
│   └── Supplier
└── Event
    ├── Order
    └── Meeting
```

**Self-check before gate**: If user made edits in the visualizer, verify:
- [ ] Modified `classes.json` and `relations.json` were saved (check file timestamps or diff)
- [ ] Any added classes still follow the schema (all required fields present)
- [ ] Any added relations reference valid domain/range classes that exist in `classes.json`
- [ ] No orphaned relations pointing to deleted classes

If the visualizer was used, re-read the JSON files to pick up user edits.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT**: You MUST use `ask_user_question`:

```
ask_user_question: "The visualizer is running. Please review the ontology structure. Ready to proceed to SQL generation (Phase 4)?"
Options:
  - "Yes, proceed to Phase 4"
  - "No, I need to make changes first"
```

### Phase 4: Generate & Deploy Ontology Layer (Layers 1-3)

**If KG path:**
Generate `01_physical_layer.sql`:
- `CREATE TABLE KG_NODE` with NODE_ID, NODE_TYPE, NAME, PROPS (VARIANT), TS_INGESTED
- `CREATE TABLE KG_EDGE` with EDGE_ID, SRC_ID, DST_ID, EDGE_TYPE, WEIGHT, PROPS, EFFECTIVE_START/END
- Both clustered by type columns
- INSERT statements to load data from source tables into KG_NODE/KG_EDGE

Generate `02_concrete_views.sql`:
- Per-class entity views: `V_{CLASS}` — typed projections from KG_NODE using `PROPS:field::TYPE`
- Per-relation relationship views: `V_{REL}` — typed projections from KG_EDGE with SRC_ID, DST_ID, WEIGHT, EFFECTIVE_START/END
- Direct-table path: thin SELECT wrappers over source tables

**For both paths:**
Generate `03_metadata_tables.sql` (~22 tables):
- Core: ONT_ONTOLOGY, ONT_CLASS, ONT_RELATION_DEF, ONT_CLASS_MAP, ONT_REL_MAP
- Source mappings: ONT_OBJECT_SOURCE, ONT_LINK_SOURCE
- Properties: ONT_SHARED_PROPERTY, ONT_PROPERTY, ONT_DERIVED_PROPERTY
- Interfaces: ONT_INTERFACE, ONT_INTERFACE_PROPERTY, ONT_INTERFACE_IMPL
- Inference: ONT_RULE, REL_EDGE_INFERRED
- Data quality: ONT_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION
- Actions: ACT_TYPE, ACT_DEF
- Functions: ONT_FUNCTION, ONT_FUNCTION_BINDING
- Views: OBJ_VIEW_DEF, OBJ_VIEW_FIELD
- RBAC: ONT_ROLE, ONT_ROLE_BINDING, ONT_PERMISSION
- Auto-populated INSERT statements derived from class/relation metadata

Generate `04_abstract_views.sql`:
- Per-class views: `VW_ONT_{CLASS_NAME}` — UNION ALL of all source tables for that class
- Hierarchy views: `VW_ONT_SUBCLASS_OF`, `VW_DESCENDANTS`, `VW_ANCESTORS`
- Unified entity view: `VW_ONT_ALL_ENTITIES`
- Stats view: `VW_ONT_HIERARCHY_STATS`
- Resolved relationships view: `REL_RESOLVED` (joins edges with node names)

Generate `05_view_generator_sp.sql`:
- `SP_GENERATE_ONTOLOGY_VIEWS()` stored procedure that reads ONT_CLASS_MAP and regenerates views dynamically

**Optional — KG path only:**
Ask the user:
```
ask_user_question: "Generate inference engine stored procedures?"
Options:
  - "Yes": Generates SP_INFER_TRANSITIVE, SP_INFER_INVERSE, SP_RUN_ONTOLOGY_INFERENCE, 
    SP_CHECK_CARDINALITY_SINGLE, SP_CHECK_REFERENTIAL — enables rule-based inference and data quality checks
  - "No": Skip inference engine (can be added later)
```

If yes, generate `06_inference_engine.sql`:
- `SP_INFER_TRANSITIVE(TARGET_REL, RULE_ID)` — recursive transitive closure (depth ≤ 5)
- `SP_INFER_INVERSE(RULE_ID)` — materialise inverse relationships from ONT_RELATION_DEF
- `SP_RUN_ONTOLOGY_INFERENCE()` — master runner for all enabled ONT_RULE entries
- `SP_CHECK_CARDINALITY_SINGLE(REL, CHECK_NAME)` — validate 1:1/N:1 constraints
- `SP_CHECK_REFERENTIAL(REL, CHECK_NAME)` — validate edge endpoint integrity
- Results written to `REL_EDGE_INFERRED` and `ONT_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION`

**KG path only**: Ask the user about SQL graph traversal tools:
```
ask_user_question: "Generate SQL graph traversal tools for the agent?"
Options:
  - "Yes": Generates 4 SQL UDF tools (EXPAND_DESCENDANTS_TOOL, GET_ANCESTORS_TOOL,
    GET_HIERARCHY_PATH_TOOL, GET_DIRECT_CHILDREN_TOOL) — zero infrastructure, pure SQL
    against KG_NODE/KG_EDGE. These are registered as generic tools in the Cortex Agent.
  - "No": Skip graph traversal tools (agent uses only semantic view tools)
```

If yes, generate `07_graph_traversal_tools.sql`:
- `EXPAND_DESCENDANTS_TOOL(ROOT_CONCEPT)` — recursive downward traversal, returns all descendants with depth and path
- `GET_ANCESTORS_TOOL(CONCEPT)` — recursive upward traversal, returns all ancestors with shortest depth
- `GET_HIERARCHY_PATH_TOOL(START_CONCEPT, END_CONCEPT)` — finds path between two concepts via subClassOf edges
- `GET_DIRECT_CHILDREN_TOOL(PARENT_CONCEPT)` — single-hop children lookup

These are complementary to SPCS graph tools (Phase 6b). SQL UDF tools handle hierarchy traversal with zero infrastructure. SPCS tools handle advanced graph algorithms (centrality, community detection) but require a container service.

Use the generator script:
```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/generate_ontology_sql.py \
  --classes-json "/tmp/ontology_parsed/classes.json" \
  --relations-json "/tmp/ontology_parsed/relations.json" \
  --mappings-json "/tmp/ontology_parsed/mappings.json" \
  --database "<DATABASE>" \
  --schema "<SCHEMA>" \
  --ontology-name "<NAME>" \
  --kg-path <true|false> \
  --include-inference <true|false> \
  --include-graph-tools <true|false> \
  --output-dir "/tmp/generated"
```

Present all generated SQL files to the user for review.

**Step 4a-verify: Completeness check (MANDATORY before asking for approval)**

Before presenting the gate, self-validate that ALL expected objects are present in the generated SQL:

| File | Expected objects |
|------|-----------------|
| `01_physical_layer.sql` (KG only) | `KG_NODE`, `KG_EDGE` tables + INSERT statements |
| `02_concrete_views.sql` | One `V_{CLASS}` view per concrete class, one `V_{REL}` view per relation |
| `03_metadata_tables.sql` | All ~22 `ONT_*` tables + INSERT seed data |
| `04_abstract_views.sql` | One `VW_ONT_{CLASS}` per class, plus `VW_ONT_SUBCLASS_OF`, `VW_DESCENDANTS`, `VW_ANCESTORS`, `VW_ONT_ALL_ENTITIES`, `VW_ONT_HIERARCHY_STATS`, `REL_RESOLVED` |
| `05_view_generator_sp.sql` | `SP_GENERATE_ONTOLOGY_VIEWS` stored procedure |
| `06_inference_engine.sql` (if selected) | `SP_INFER_TRANSITIVE`, `SP_INFER_INVERSE`, `SP_RUN_ONTOLOGY_INFERENCE`, `SP_CHECK_CARDINALITY_SINGLE`, `SP_CHECK_REFERENTIAL` |
| `07_graph_traversal_tools.sql` (if selected) | `EXPAND_DESCENDANTS_TOOL`, `GET_ANCESTORS_TOOL`, `GET_HIERARCHY_PATH_TOOL`, `GET_DIRECT_CHILDREN_TOOL` |

Cross-check: count the CREATE VIEW/TABLE/PROCEDURE statements in each file against the expected counts derived from `classes.json` and `relations.json`. If anything is missing, fix the generation before presenting to the user. Do NOT ask the user to approve incomplete SQL.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT — DO NOT EXECUTE SQL**: Present the completeness summary and all generated SQL files. You MUST use `ask_user_question` to get explicit approval before executing any SQL:

```
ask_user_question: "Phase 4 SQL generation complete. I've generated the SQL files listed above. Ready to deploy to Snowflake?"
Options:
  - "Yes, deploy all SQL"
  - "No, I need to review/change something first"
```

DO NOT execute any SQL statements, DO NOT proceed to Step 4b, until the user explicitly approves via the question above.

**Step 4b: Deploy SQL artifacts (Layers 1-3)**

After approval, execute all SQL scripts in order so that tables and views exist for Phases 5-6:

1. **Physical layer** (if KG path): Execute `01_physical_layer.sql`
2. **Concrete views**: Execute `02_concrete_views.sql` (V_{CLASS} entity views, V_{REL} relationship views)
3. **Metadata tables**: Execute `03_metadata_tables.sql` (~22 tables + auto-populated seed data)
4. **Abstract views**: Execute `04_abstract_views.sql`
5. **View generator SP**: Execute `05_view_generator_sp.sql`
6. **Inference engine** (if selected): Execute `06_inference_engine.sql`
7. **SPCS graph service** (if selected): Execute `spcs_setup.sql`
8. **Graph traversal tools** (if selected): Execute `07_graph_traversal_tools.sql`

Quick-validate that key objects exist:
```sql
SHOW VIEWS LIKE 'VW_ONT_%' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'ONT_%' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
-- If graph traversal tools selected:
SHOW USER FUNCTIONS LIKE '%_TOOL' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
```

Present a deployment summary to the user:
- Number of tables created (KG tables + ONT_* metadata tables)
- Number of views created (V_* concrete views + VW_ONT_* abstract views)
- Number of stored procedures created
- Number of UDFs created (if graph traversal tools selected)
- Any warnings or errors encountered during execution

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT — DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 5**

Before you can present the gate question, you MUST complete ALL of the following steps in order. Do NOT skip any step. Do NOT present the gate question until all 3 steps are done.

**Required Step A: Generate deployed-objects manifest**

Build a `deployed_objects.json` manifest from the SHOW commands output. The manifest maps each ontology concept to its generated Snowflake artifact(s), enabling the visualizer to show the "Original Design → Snowflake Implementation" mapping.

Write the manifest to `/tmp/ontology_parsed/deployed_objects.json`:
```json
{
  "source": "<original input — e.g. 'healthcare_ontology.owl' or 'User-described ontology'>",
  "database": "{DATABASE}",
  "schema": "{SCHEMA}",
  "views": ["V_DOCTOR", "V_PATIENT", "VW_ONT_PERSON", "VW_ONT_ALL_ENTITIES", ...],
  "tables": ["KG_NODE", "KG_EDGE", "ONT_CLASS_DEF", "ONT_RELATION_DEF", ...],
  "procedures": ["SP_GENERATE_ONTOLOGY_VIEWS", ...],
  "udfs": ["EXPAND_DESCENDANTS_TOOL", ...],
  "class_to_objects": {
    "Doctor": {"views": ["V_DOCTOR", "VW_ONT_DOCTOR"], "metadata_row": "ONT_CLASS_DEF"},
    "Patient": {"views": ["V_PATIENT", "VW_ONT_PATIENT"], "metadata_row": "ONT_CLASS_DEF"},
    "Person": {"views": ["VW_ONT_PERSON"], "metadata_row": "ONT_CLASS_DEF"}
  },
  "relation_to_objects": {
    "treats": {"view": "V_TREATS", "metadata_row": "ONT_RELATION_DEF"},
    "subClassOf": {"view": "VW_ONT_SUBCLASS_OF", "metadata_row": "ONT_RELATION_DEF"}
  }
}
```

Build the `class_to_objects` mapping by iterating `classes.json`:
- For each concrete class: look for `V_{CLASS_NAME}` in the views list → add to views array
- For each class (abstract or concrete): look for `VW_ONT_{CLASS_NAME}` in the views list → add to views array
- Every class gets `"metadata_row": "ONT_CLASS_DEF"` since all classes are seeded into that table

Build the `relation_to_objects` mapping by iterating `relations.json`:
- For each relation: look for `V_{RELATION_NAME}` in the views list → set as view
- Every relation gets `"metadata_row": "ONT_RELATION_DEF"`

**Required Step B: Re-launch the visualizer with coverage mapping**

Stop the Phase 3 visualizer if still running, then re-launch with the `--deployed-objects` flag:
```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/visualize_ontology.py -- \
  --classes-json "/tmp/ontology_parsed/classes.json" \
  --relations-json "/tmp/ontology_parsed/relations.json" \
  --deployed-objects "/tmp/ontology_parsed/deployed_objects.json" \
  --port 8501
```

Without re-launching, the graph will show all nodes as unmapped (red). After re-launch with `--deployed-objects`, nodes will be colored by implementation status:
- **Coverage tab**: "Original Design → Snowflake Implementation" with progress bar, 3-column breakdown (Mapped / Covered by Ancestor / Unmapped), and full artifact inventory
- **Graph tab**: Nodes colored green (mapped), blue (covered by ancestor), red (unmapped), gray (abstract)
- **Node detail**: Click any node to see its deployed Snowflake objects

**Required Step C: Verify the visualizer shows coverage (NOT all red/unmapped)**

Open the visualizer and confirm that concrete classes show as green (mapped) or blue (covered), NOT red (unmapped). If everything is still red, the manifest was not loaded — check the `--deployed-objects` path and re-launch.

**Only after Steps A, B, C are done**, present the gate question using `ask_user_question`:

```
ask_user_question: "Phase 4 deployment complete. All Layer 1-3 objects are deployed. The visualizer is showing the coverage mapping. Ready to proceed to Phase 4.5 (Base Semantic View)?"
Options:
  - "Yes, proceed to Phase 4.5"
  - "No, I need to fix something first"
```

DO NOT invoke the `semantic-view` skill, DO NOT start Phase 4.5 or Phase 5, and DO NOT continue until the user explicitly confirms via the question above.

### Phase 4.5: Ensure Base Semantic View — via `semantic-view` skill

The final delivery always includes a **base semantic view** that covers the source tables directly (for concrete data queries). This phase ensures one exists — either by reusing an existing semantic view or creating a new one.

**If existing semantic view selected in Phase 1 (Step 1b):**

Skip this phase entirely — including the Phase 4.5 gate below. The user's existing semantic view becomes the base. Record its FQN:
```
base_semantic_view = "{DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{EXISTING_SEMANTIC_VIEW_NAME}"
```

Proceed directly to Phase 5 (do NOT present the Phase 4.5 gate question).

**If no existing semantic view (create from scratch):**

Invoke the native **`semantic-view` skill** (creation mode) to build a base semantic view over the **original source tables** (not the VW_ONT_* views — those are covered in Phase 5):

```
skill: semantic-view

Context to provide when the skill asks:
  - Semantic view name: {ONTOLOGY_NAME}_BASE
  - Target database: {DATABASE}
  - Target schema: {SCHEMA}
  - Table references: The original source tables from Phase 1
    (e.g., COMPANIES_ENRICHED, SECURITIES, EXCHANGES, SECTORS, etc.)
  - SQL queries: Convert the business questions from Phase 1 into SELECT statements
    against the source tables (these become VQRs in the semantic model)
  - Business context: "Base data layer semantic view for direct queries against source tables.
    Use for specific entity lookups, aggregations, filtering by attributes, and concrete
    data questions that don't require ontology reasoning."
```

The `semantic-view` skill will:
1. Call FastGen to auto-generate the semantic model YAML from the source table metadata
2. Validate the YAML via `SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML(..., TRUE)`
3. Present the generated model for review
4. Deploy the semantic view

**Step 4.5a: Test the base semantic view**

Invoke the `semantic-view` skill in **audit** mode to validate:
```
skill: semantic-view

Context: Audit the semantic view {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_BASE
  - Run 2-3 of the business questions from Phase 1 against the base semantic view
  - Verify the generated SQL executes without errors
  - Verify the results contain expected data (non-empty, reasonable values)
  - If any query fails, use the skill's refine workflow to fix the semantic model
```

Record the base semantic view FQN:
```
base_semantic_view = "{DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_BASE"
```

**Self-check before gate**: Verify the base semantic view is ready:
- [ ] Base semantic view exists: `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS LIKE '{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_BASE' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}`
  (or existing semantic view confirmed in Phase 1)
- [ ] At least 2 business questions returned non-empty results via audit
- [ ] `base_semantic_view` FQN is recorded for use in Phase 6

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT — DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 5**: You MUST use `ask_user_question`:

```
ask_user_question: "Base semantic view is ready ({base_semantic_view}). Ready to proceed to Phase 5 (Ontology Semantic Views)?"
Options:
  - "Yes, proceed to Phase 5"
  - "No, I need to fix the base semantic view"
```

### Phase 5: Create Ontology Semantic Views (Layer 4) — via `semantic-view` skill

> **Note**: The **base semantic view** (covering source tables directly) was already created or identified in Phase 4.5. This phase creates **ontology-layer** semantic views over the objects deployed in Phase 4 (VW_ONT_*, V_*, ONT_* tables).

Ask the user which **ontology-layer** semantic views to create:

```
ask_user_question: "Which ontology-layer semantic views should I create? (The base semantic view over source tables is already ready from Phase 4.5.)"
multiSelect: true
Options:
  - "KG Semantic View": Concrete entity views (V_{CLASS}) and relationship views (V_{REL}) for fast direct queries
    [Only available if KG path chosen]
  - "Ontology Semantic View": Abstract views (VW_ONT_*) for cross-type reasoning
  - "Metadata & Governance Semantic View": All ~22 ONT_* introspection tables for governance and data quality
```

**For each selected semantic view**, invoke the native **`semantic-view` skill** (creation mode) to generate, validate, and deploy the semantic view. The skill uses Snowflake's FastGen system function which auto-discovers columns, infers primary keys, generates dimensions/measures/metrics/relationships, and creates verified queries.

**Step 5a: Determine base tables for each model**

Gather the base tables from the ontology objects deployed in Phase 4:

- **KG Semantic View**: List all `V_{CLASS}` entity views and `V_{REL}` relationship views:
  ```sql
  SHOW VIEWS LIKE 'V_%' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
  ```
- **Ontology Semantic View**: List all `VW_ONT_%` abstract views:
  ```sql
  SHOW VIEWS LIKE 'VW_ONT_%' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
  ```
- **Metadata Semantic View**: List all `ONT_%` metadata tables:
  ```sql
  SHOW TABLES LIKE 'ONT_%' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
  ```

**Step 5b: Invoke the `semantic-view` skill for each selected model**

For each selected model, invoke the skill with this context:

```
skill: semantic-view

Context to provide when the skill asks:
  - Semantic view name: {ONTOLOGY_NAME}_KG_MODEL (or _ONTOLOGY_MODEL or _METADATA_MODEL)
  - Target database: {DATABASE}
  - Target schema: {SCHEMA}
  - Table references: The base tables gathered in Step 5a
  - SQL queries: Convert the business questions from Phase 1 into SELECT statements
    against the base tables (these become VQRs in the semantic model)
  - Business context: Describe the model's purpose and intent-routing role
```

The `semantic-view` skill will:
1. Call FastGen to auto-generate the semantic model YAML from the actual Snowflake metadata
2. Validate the YAML via `SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML(..., TRUE)`
3. Present the generated model for review
4. Offer options: audit, deploy, or refine

**Step 5c: Deploy each semantic view**

Use the `semantic-view` skill's upload workflow to deploy each approved semantic view to Snowflake:
```sql
-- The skill handles this via upload_semantic_view_yaml.py, which runs:
-- CALL SYSTEM$CREATE_SEMANTIC_VIEW_FROM_YAML('{DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}', $${yaml}$$, FALSE);
```

Verify deployment:
```sql
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
```

**Step 5d: Test each semantic view**

For each deployed semantic view, invoke the `semantic-view` skill in **audit/test** mode to validate it returns correct results:

```
skill: semantic-view

Context: Audit the semantic view {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{SEMANTIC_VIEW_NAME}
  - Run 2-3 of the business questions from Phase 1 against each semantic view
  - Verify the generated SQL executes without errors
  - Verify the results contain expected data (non-empty, reasonable values)
  - If any query fails, use the skill's refine workflow to fix the semantic model
```

The `semantic-view` skill will test queries via Cortex Analyst, show generated SQL and results, and flag any issues.

**Self-check before gate**: Verify all semantic views are complete:
- [ ] `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}` returns one row per selected model
- [ ] Each semantic view name matches expected naming ({ONTOLOGY_NAME}_KG_MODEL, _ONTOLOGY_MODEL, _METADATA_MODEL)
- [ ] Step 5d tests passed — at least 2 business questions per view returned non-empty results
- [ ] No unresolved validation errors from the `semantic-view` skill

If any semantic view is missing or tests failed, fix before presenting the gate.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT — DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 6**: You MUST use `ask_user_question`:

```
ask_user_question: "All semantic views are deployed. Please review and test them. Ready to proceed to Phase 6 (Agent creation)?"
Options:
  - "Yes, proceed to Phase 6"
  - "No, I need to fix a semantic view"
```

### Phase 6: Create Cortex Agent (Layer 5) — via `cortex-agent` skill

**Step 6a: Build the tool inventory from prior phases**

Enumerate exactly which tools are available based on what was deployed in earlier phases. Do NOT include tools for semantic views or graph UDFs that were not created.

```
TOOL_INVENTORY = []
```

**1. Base semantic view (ALWAYS present):**

```sql
-- Verify the base semantic view exists
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS LIKE '{base_semantic_view_name}' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
```

- Source: Phase 4.5 (newly created `{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_BASE`) **or** Phase 1 (existing semantic view selected by user)
- FQN: `{base_semantic_view}` (recorded in Phase 4.5 or Phase 1)
- Tool: `name=base_query_tool, type=cortex_analyst_text_to_sql`
- → **Add `base_query_tool` to TOOL_INVENTORY**

**2. Ontology-layer semantic views (only those actually created in Phase 5):**

Check which ontology-layer semantic views the user selected and the `semantic-view` skill deployed. For EACH one that exists:

- If **KG semantic view** was created (`{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_KG_MODEL`) → add `kg_query_tool` to TOOL_INVENTORY
- If **Ontology semantic view** was created (`{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_ONTOLOGY_MODEL`) → add `ontology_query_tool` to TOOL_INVENTORY
- If **Metadata semantic view** was created (`{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_METADATA_MODEL`) → add `metadata_query_tool` to TOOL_INVENTORY

Do NOT add tools for semantic views that were not selected or not deployed.

**3. Graph traversal UDFs (only if KG path AND deployed in Phase 4):**

If KG path was chosen AND `07_graph_traversal_tools.sql` was generated and deployed:

```sql
-- Verify UDFs exist
SHOW USER FUNCTIONS LIKE '%_TOOL' IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
```

- If all 4 UDFs exist → add `expand_descendants_tool`, `get_ancestors_tool`, `get_hierarchy_path_tool`, `get_direct_children_tool` to TOOL_INVENTORY

If Direct path was chosen, skip this entirely — do not add any graph tools.

**4. SPCS graph tools (only if selected in Step 6b):**

If SPCS service functions were deployed → add each service function tool to TOOL_INVENTORY.

**Cross-check:** Run `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};` and verify every semantic view maps to exactly one tool in TOOL_INVENTORY. Flag any mismatch.

**Record the final inventory:**
```
TOOL_INVENTORY = [list of tool names]
Total tools: {N}
```

Present this to the user before proceeding: *"The agent will have {N} tools: {list}. Correct?"*

**Step 6b: Check for graph analytics tools (KG path only)**

If KG path, check what graph tools were deployed in Phase 4:

- **SQL UDF graph traversal tools**: If `07_graph_traversal_tools.sql` was generated and deployed, the 4 UDFs (`EXPAND_DESCENDANTS_TOOL`, `GET_ANCESTORS_TOOL`, `GET_HIERARCHY_PATH_TOOL`, `GET_DIRECT_CHILDREN_TOOL`) are already available and should be registered as `generic` tools in the agent.
- **SPCS graph analytics tools**: If user also wants advanced graph algorithms (centrality, community detection), offer SPCS:

```
ask_user_question: "Include SPCS graph analytics tools in the agent? (SQL hierarchy tools are already deployed)"
Options:
  - "Yes": Adds centrality, community detection, shortest path tools (requires SPCS container service)
  - "No": Agent uses semantic view tools + SQL graph traversal tools only
```

If SPCS selected, generate SPCS scaffolding only (no agent spec):
```bash
uv run --project <SKILL_DIR> python <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/generate_spcs_scaffolding.py \
  --database "<DATABASE>" \
  --schema "<SCHEMA>" \
  --output-dir "/tmp/generated"
```
This produces:
- `spcs_graph_service.py` — NetworkX-based graph analytics service
- `spcs_setup.sql` — SPCS service creation, compute pool, service functions

Guide the user through deploying the SPCS service before proceeding:
```sql
-- Execute spcs_setup.sql to create the compute pool, image repository,
-- service, and service functions in {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}
```

**Step 6c: Invoke the `cortex-agent` skill to create the agent**

Invoke the native `cortex-agent` skill in **create** mode:

```
skill: cortex-agent

Context to provide when the skill asks:
  - Agent name: {ONTOLOGY_NAME}_AGENT
  - Target database: {DATABASE}
  - Target schema: {SCHEMA}

  - Tools (include ONLY tools present in TOOL_INVENTORY — skip any section below
    whose tool is not in the inventory):

    1. base_query_tool (ALWAYS in TOOL_INVENTORY):
       Tool: name=base_query_tool, type=cortex_analyst_text_to_sql, semantic_view="{base_semantic_view}"
         description: Build dynamically — include "When to Use" and "When NOT to Use".
           When to Use: "specific entity questions, counts, statistics, filtering by properties,
             concrete data retrieval from original source tables."
           When NOT to Use: Build this list ONLY from other tools in TOOL_INVENTORY:
             - If ontology_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY → "cross-type ontology reasoning (use ontology_query_tool)"
             - If kg_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY → "concrete KG entity lookups (use kg_query_tool)"
             - If metadata_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY → "governance questions (use metadata_query_tool)"
             - If graph tools in TOOL_INVENTORY → "hierarchy traversal (use graph tools)"
             Omit any line whose tool is NOT in TOOL_INVENTORY.

    2. Ontology-layer semantic view tools — one entry per tool in TOOL_INVENTORY
       from Phase 5. Skip any that were not deployed:

       IF kg_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY:
         Tool: name=kg_query_tool, type=cortex_analyst_text_to_sql,
               semantic_view="{DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_KG_MODEL"
           description:
             "When to Use: concrete entity/relationship queries via V_* typed views —
               specific entity lookups, filtering by attributes, aggregations.
             When NOT to Use: {only reference tools in TOOL_INVENTORY —
               e.g., 'hierarchy traversal (use graph tools)' only if graph tools exist,
               'source table queries (use base_query_tool)' always}"

       IF ontology_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY:
         Tool: name=ontology_query_tool, type=cortex_analyst_text_to_sql,
               semantic_view="{DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_ONTOLOGY_MODEL"
           description:
             "When to Use: cross-type reasoning via VW_ONT_* abstract views —

               e.g., 'concrete source data (use base_query_tool)' always,
               'governance/coverage (use metadata_query_tool)' only if it exists}"

       IF metadata_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY:
         Tool: name=metadata_query_tool, type=cortex_analyst_text_to_sql,
               semantic_view="{DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_METADATA_MODEL"
           description:
             "When to Use: governance, coverage, data quality, mapping status

               'ontology reasoning (use ontology_query_tool)' only if it exists}"

    3. SQL UDF graph tools — ONLY if graph tools are in TOOL_INVENTORY
       (i.e., KG path chosen AND UDFs deployed in Phase 4).
       If graph tools are NOT in TOOL_INVENTORY, skip this entire section.

       Each tool needs type=generic with tool_resources type=function, a detailed
       description with routing hints, and an input_schema matching the UDF parameters.

       Tool: name=expand_descendants_tool, type=generic
         function: {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.EXPAND_DESCENDANTS_TOOL
         input_schema: { "ROOT_CONCEPT": { "type": "string", "description": "The concept name to expand (e.g., 'Vehicle', 'Manager')" } }
         required: ["ROOT_CONCEPT"]
         description: "Get ALL descendants of a root concept in the ontology hierarchy.
           Returns NODE_ID, NODE_NAME, DEPTH, PATH for the root and every descendant.
           When to Use: questions with 'all types of', 'subtypes', 'derived from',
           'everything under X', cohort expansion.
           When NOT to Use: single entity lookups (use base_query_tool), ancestor
           questions (use get_ancestors_tool)."

       Tool: name=get_ancestors_tool, type=generic
         function: {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.GET_ANCESTORS_TOOL
         input_schema: { "CONCEPT": { "type": "string", "description": "The concept name to find ancestors for" } }
         required: ["CONCEPT"]

           When NOT to Use: descendant listing (use expand_descendants_tool), path
           between two specific concepts (use get_hierarchy_path_tool)."

         input_schema: {

           subtypes of X?', browsing one level at a time.
           When NOT to Use: need ALL descendants recursively (use expand_descendants_tool)."

  - Orchestration instructions — ASSEMBLE dynamically from TOOL_INVENTORY.
    Only include routing blocks for tools that are actually in the inventory.
    Do NOT include routing for tools the agent does not have.

    (provide this as the agent's orchestration prompt):

    "You are an ontology-driven analytics agent for the {ONTOLOGY_NAME} domain.
    You have {len(TOOL_INVENTORY)} tools: {comma-separated list of tool names from TOOL_INVENTORY}.

    ## Tool Selection Strategy

    Step 1: Classify the question type and route to the correct tool:
    {ASSEMBLE the classification list below — include ONLY lines whose tool is in TOOL_INVENTORY}

    - DATA QUERY: specific entity lookups, filtering, aggregation from source tables → base_query_tool
    {IF ontology_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY:}
    - ONTOLOGY REASONING: cross-type questions, abstract view queries → ontology_query_tool
    {IF kg_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY:}
    - ENTITY/RELATIONSHIP LOOKUP: concrete KG entity data via typed views → kg_query_tool
    {IF metadata_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY:}
    - METADATA/GOVERNANCE: coverage, mapping status, data quality → metadata_query_tool
    {IF graph tools in TOOL_INVENTORY:}
    - HIERARCHY TRAVERSAL: descendants, ancestors, paths, subtypes → graph traversal tools

    Step 2: Detailed routing:

    **Use base_query_tool when:**
    - Question asks about specific entities by name, attribute, or property from source data
    - Need aggregations, counts, or statistics directly from source tables
    - Questions are concrete data lookups
    - Example: 'How many companies are in the Technology sector?', 'List all securities for company X'

    {IF ontology_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY — include this block:}
    **Use ontology_query_tool when:**
    - Cross-type reasoning via VW_ONT_* abstract views
    - Questions spanning multiple entity types through the ontology lens
    - Example: 'Show all mapped entities of type Organization'

    {IF kg_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY — include this block:}
    **Use kg_query_tool when:**
    - Concrete entity/relationship queries via V_* typed views
    - Need specific entity data or relationship data through the KG structure
    - Example: 'List all V_COMPANY records', 'Show relationships for entity X'

    {IF metadata_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY — include this block:}
    **Use metadata_query_tool when:**
    - Questions about governance, coverage, data quality, mapping status
    - Example: 'What percentage of classes are mapped?', 'Show unmapped relations'

    {IF graph tools in TOOL_INVENTORY — include ALL FOUR blocks below:}

    **Use expand_descendants_tool when:**
    - 'All types of X', 'everything under X', 'subtypes of X'
    - Cohort expansion — need to find all members of a category
    - Keywords: 'derived', 'all types', 'subtypes', 'descendants', 'under'

    **Use get_ancestors_tool when:**
    - 'What is X?', 'What category does X belong to?'
    - Understanding classification or lineage of a specific concept
    - Keywords: 'ancestors', 'parent', 'category', 'belongs to', 'classified as'

    **Use get_hierarchy_path_tool when:**
    - 'How is X related to Y?', 'Path from X to Y'
    - Understanding the chain of relationships between two concepts
    - Keywords: 'path', 'related to', 'connection between', 'lineage from...to'

    **Use get_direct_children_tool when:**
    - 'Direct subtypes of X', 'immediate children of X'
    - Browsing the hierarchy one level at a time
    - Keywords: 'direct', 'immediate', 'one level'

    {END graph tools conditional}

    {IF len(TOOL_INVENTORY) > 2 — include Combining Tools section:}
    ## Combining Tools
    For complex questions, you may call multiple tools:
    {IF graph tools in TOOL_INVENTORY:}
    - First expand a hierarchy, then query data about the expanded set
    - First find ancestors to understand classification, then query related entities
    {IF metadata_query_tool in TOOL_INVENTORY:}
    - First check metadata for coverage status, then query concrete data for uncovered areas
    {ALWAYS if > 2 tools:}
    - Use ontology tool for cross-type discovery, then base tool for detailed results
    {END Combining Tools conditional}
    "

  - Response instructions: Return structured answers with source attribution.
    When showing hierarchy results, include depth and path information.
    When combining tools, explain the reasoning chain.
```

The `cortex-agent` skill will:
1. Verify admin setup (warehouse, role, permissions)
2. Gather requirements and confirm tool selection
3. Build the agent spec with all tools (semantic views + graph UDFs) and `tool_resources`
4. Execute `CREATE OR REPLACE AGENT` via `$spec$` DDL
5. Run verification queries to confirm the agent is functional

**IMPORTANT**: For the graph traversal UDF tools, ensure the `tool_resources` uses `"type": "function"` (not `"procedure"`), since these are SQL UDFs not stored procedures:
```json
"tool_resources": {
  "expand_descendants_tool": {
    "type": "function",
    "identifier": "{DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.EXPAND_DESCENDANTS_TOOL",
    "execution_environment": { "type": "warehouse", "query_timeout": 180 }
  }
}
```

**Step 6d: Add SPCS graph tools to the agent (if selected in 6b)**

If SPCS graph tools were selected in Step 6b, invoke the `cortex-agent` skill again in **edit** mode to add the SPCS service functions as stored-procedure tools:

```
skill: cortex-agent

Context: Edit agent {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_AGENT
  - Add tools: Each SPCS service function as a stored-procedure tool
    (e.g., graph_centrality, graph_community_detection, graph_shortest_path)
  - Update orchestration instructions to include graph analytics routing
```

**Step 6e: Test the agent via `cortex-agent` skill**

Invoke the `cortex-agent` skill in **test/debug** mode to validate the agent works end-to-end.

Generate **one sample question per tool in TOOL_INVENTORY** using domain-specific examples from the business questions collected in Phase 1. Only test tools that exist:

```
skill: cortex-agent

Context: Test the agent {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_AGENT
  - The agent has {len(TOOL_INVENTORY)} tools: {list from TOOL_INVENTORY}
  - Run one sample question per tool to confirm intent routing:

    FOR EACH tool in TOOL_INVENTORY, generate a test question:
    - base_query_tool: A concrete data question from the Phase 1 business questions
      e.g., "How many entities are in the source data?" or "List top 10 records from {SOURCE_TABLE}"
    - kg_query_tool (only if in inventory): An entity/relationship question via typed views
      e.g., "List all entities of type X"
    - ontology_query_tool (only if in inventory): A cross-type reasoning question
      e.g., "Show all mapped entities of type Organization"
    - metadata_query_tool (only if in inventory): A governance/coverage question
      e.g., "What percentage of classes are mapped?", "Show all class mappings"
    - expand_descendants_tool (only if in inventory): "Show all subtypes of {ROOT_CLASS}"
    - get_ancestors_tool (only if in inventory): "What categories does {LEAF_CLASS} belong to?"
    - get_hierarchy_path_tool (only if in inventory): "What is the path from {LEAF_CLASS} to {ROOT_CLASS}?"
    - get_direct_children_tool (only if in inventory): "What are the direct subtypes of {ROOT_CLASS}?"

  - Verify each question routes to the CORRECT tool
  - Verify responses contain expected data (non-empty, hierarchy depths make sense)
  - If a question routes to the wrong tool, the orchestration instructions need
    refinement — update tool descriptions or orchestration
  - If any test fails, use the skill's debug workflow to diagnose and fix
```

The `cortex-agent` skill will run the queries, show which tool was invoked, and flag routing or response issues.

**Self-check before gate**: Verify the agent matches TOOL_INVENTORY:
- [ ] `SHOW AGENTS IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}` returns the agent ({ONTOLOGY_NAME}_AGENT)
- [ ] Agent total tool count matches TOOL_INVENTORY count: expected {len(TOOL_INVENTORY)} tools
- [ ] Each tool name in TOOL_INVENTORY is registered in the agent (no missing, no extras)
- [ ] Step 6e tests passed — each tool in TOOL_INVENTORY received at least one correctly-routed question with non-empty response
- [ ] No unresolved errors from the `cortex-agent` skill

If agent is missing, has wrong tool count, or tests failed, fix before presenting the gate.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT — DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 7**: You MUST use `ask_user_question`:

```
ask_user_question: "The Cortex Agent is deployed. Please test it with the questions above. Ready to proceed to Phase 7 (Validation)?"
Options:
  - "Yes, proceed to Phase 7"
  - "No, I need to fix the agent"
```

### Phase 7: End-to-End Validation

> **Note**: SQL artifacts (L1-L3) were deployed in Phase 4b. Base semantic view (L4-base) was deployed in Phase 4.5. Ontology-layer semantic views (L4-ontology) and Cortex Agent (L5) were deployed by native skills in Phases 5 and 6. This phase validates the full stack.

**Step 7a: Validate all layers**

Run validation queries across the full stack:

- **L1 Physical**: Row counts for KG_NODE and KG_EDGE (if KG path)
- **L2 Metadata**: Row counts for all ~22 ONT_* tables
- **L3 Abstract Views**: Sample queries against each VW_ONT_* view
- **L4 Semantic Views**: Verify via `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}` — must include base semantic (Phase 4.5) + ontology-layer semantics (Phase 5)
- **L5 Cortex Agent**: Run one end-to-end question through the agent:
  ```sql
  SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.AGENT(
    '{DATABASE}.{SCHEMA}.{ONTOLOGY_NAME}_AGENT',
    PARSE_JSON('{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "<domain question from Phase 1>"}]}')
  );
  ```

Present a summary table of all deployed objects with row counts and status.

**Self-check before gate**: Verify the full stack is healthy:
- [ ] L1: KG_NODE and KG_EDGE have non-zero row counts (if KG path)
- [ ] L2: All ~22 ONT_* tables exist and have seed data (row count > 0 for at least ONT_CLASS, ONT_RELATION_DEF, ONT_CLASS_MAP)
- [ ] L3: Every VW_ONT_* view returns rows without errors
- [ ] L4: `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS` count matches expected: 1 base (Phase 4.5) + N ontology-layer (Phase 5 selections)
- [ ] L5: Agent query returned a meaningful response (not an error or empty)

If any layer fails validation, report the specific failure and attempt to fix (re-execute SQL, re-deploy view, etc.) before presenting the gate. Do NOT present a "deployment complete" gate with known failures.

**⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINT — FINAL GATE**: You MUST use `ask_user_question`:

```
ask_user_question: "End-to-end validation complete. All layers are deployed and verified. Is the deployment complete?"
Options:
  - "Yes, deployment is complete"
  - "No, there are issues to address"
```

## Degrees of Freedom

| Decision | Freedom | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| KG vs direct-table path | **High** | Ask in Phase 1 |
| Use existing semantic vs create new base | **High** | Ask in Phase 1 (Step 1b) |
| Which ontology-layer semantic models (1-3) | **High** | All 3 if KG, 2 if direct |
| Graph analytics tools | **High** | Only offered if KG path |
| Ontology class/relation design | **Medium** | AI recommends, user confirms |
| View naming convention | **Low** | `VW_ONT_` prefix |
| Agent routing instructions | **Low** | Auto-generated from model descriptions |

## Error Handling

- **No tables found**: Verify DATABASE.SCHEMA exists and user has SELECT permission
- **OWL parse failure**: Check file format (OWL/XML, Turtle, RDF/XML). Parser auto-detects.
- **SQL execution error**: Show exact error, suggest GRANT statements if permission issue
- **Empty views**: Verify filter conditions in ONT_CLASS_MAP match actual data values
- **Semantic model validation failure**: Check that all referenced views exist and have data

## Session Resume

If invoked mid-session, check `/tmp/generated/`, `/tmp/ontology_parsed/`, and Snowflake objects for existing artifacts:
- If `classes.json` exists → resume from Phase 3 (visualize)
- If `*.sql` files exist but not yet executed → resume from Phase 4b (deploy SQL)
- If `VW_ONT_*` views exist but no base semantic view → resume from Phase 4.5 (base semantic via `semantic-view` skill)
- If base semantic view exists but no ontology-layer semantic views → resume from Phase 5 (ontology semantic views via `semantic-view` skill)
- If ontology-layer semantic views exist but no agent → resume from Phase 6 (agent via `cortex-agent` skill)
- If agent exists → resume from Phase 7 (validation)

To detect base semantic view, run:
```sql
SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS IN SCHEMA {DATABASE}.{SCHEMA};
```
Check if any semantic view covers the **source tables** (not VW_ONT_* or V_* views). If found, record it as `base_semantic_view` and skip Phase 4.5.

Always confirm the detected state with the user before proceeding.

## Output Files

SQL artifacts are saved to `/tmp/generated/` during the session. Semantic views and the Cortex Agent are deployed directly to Snowflake by the native skills (no local YAML or JSON files).
